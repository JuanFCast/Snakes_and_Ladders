# Snakes_and_Ladders
## What is Snakes and Ladders? :snake: :joystick:
This program is inspired by the classic game "Snakes and Ladders", come and play this fun game that was born in the physical and evolved in the virtual. To play you need to assign the size of your board, the number of snakes and ladders you want on your board, and finally type a string with the symbols that represent each player (minimum 2 players, maximum 9 players). Once the game environment is ready, you start rolling a die that goes from 1 to 6 and, depending on the number the player rolls, he/she must advance in squares. On the other hand, if a ladder is found, the player climbs up the ladder to the square where it ends. Otherwise, if a snake is found, the player must go down to the square where the snake ends. The winner of the game is the first player to reach the last square in the grid.
